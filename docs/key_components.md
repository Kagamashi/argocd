### ArgoCD Architecture Overview

#### 1. **API Server**
The **API Server** is the primary interface through which users interact with ArgoCD. It serves as the entry point for all user commands and actions.
- **Interfaces**: Provides both a REST API and CLI for managing and monitoring applications.
- **Web UI**: Hosts the ArgoCD web user interface (UI) for easy user interaction.
- **Authentication and Access Control**: Handles user authentication and enforces access control through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

When users issue commands (via CLI or UI), they pass through the API Server, which then triggers appropriate actions by interacting with the **Repository Server** or **Application Controller**.

#### 2. **Repository Server**
The **Repository Server** manages Git repository content and ensures that ArgoCD has access to the desired application configuration.
- **Fetching Manifests**: Retrieves application manifests (YAML files) from configured Git repositories.
- **Caching**: Parses and caches these manifests for faster access by other ArgoCD components.
- **Validation**: Validates the structure of the repository and retrieves the current state of applications from Git.

Whenever ArgoCD needs to sync or validate the state of an application, the **Repository Server** fetches the most up-to-date manifests from Git.

#### 3. **Application Controller**
The **Application Controller** is responsible for maintaining the desired state of applications, as defined in Git, in the live Kubernetes cluster.
- **State Reconciliation**: Continuously watches both the Git repository and Kubernetes cluster, comparing the desired state (in Git) with the live state (in Kubernetes).
- **Sync Operations**: When a difference is detected, the controller triggers sync operations to align the actual Kubernetes state with the desired state from Git.
- **Health Management**: Monitors the health of applications, ensuring that resources remain in sync and reporting any errors.

The **Application Controller** is the heart of the ArgoCD reconciliation loop, ensuring that the live state of the application matches the Git-declared state by interacting with the **Repository Server** and the Kubernetes API.

#### 4. **Dex (Authentication Component)**
The **Dex** component manages Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication for ArgoCD.
- **OAuth/OIDC Support**: Integrates with external identity providers like Google, GitHub, or enterprise SSO for user authentication.
- **Identity Management**: Supports external identity management, allowing users to authenticate through their preferred provider.

### Example GitOps Workflow with ArgoCD

1. **Commit to Git**: A developer commits new configuration or application code (YAML, Helm charts, etc.) to the Git repository.
2. **Fetching Changes**: ArgoCD detects the new commit and fetches the latest configuration through the **Repository Server**.
3. **State Comparison**: The **Application Controller** compares the desired state from Git with the actual state in the Kubernetes cluster.
4. **Syncing**: If a difference is detected, ArgoCD synchronizes the cluster by applying the necessary changes to Kubernetes using the Kubernetes API.
5. **Status Monitoring**: ArgoCD continuously monitors the health and status of the application to ensure it remains in sync and healthy.
